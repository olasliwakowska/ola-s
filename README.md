# hello

Hi!

I have problem with IPython 3-5 after upgrading to jupyter. I use Anacondy 4.0 and packages  https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs#python-3-5). Whenever I try to open a notebook and write some math definition or command program doesn't work, it hangs. Is like all the time in work, because the left side is shown In [*]. My commands aren't green. 

In the terminal, I see:
Deactivating environment "C:\Anaconda3"...
Activating environment "C:\Anaconda3"...

[Anaconda3] C:\Users\Aleksandra>ipython notebook
